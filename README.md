# AdminX (WIP)

AdminX is feature-packed, responsive admin template based on [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/). It's currently under active development so if you have any idea on what you like to see in it, feel free to tell us.

Check out the Demo [here](https://movact.github.io/AdminX/index.html) if you want to have a look at the current progress.

### Credit
Credit is where credit's due: This admin template is inspired by the great [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/), which is why you might encounter similarity in terms of scope, but we do write all our own components and don't use any of AdminLTEs code. AdminLTE is also based on Bootstrap 3 and therefore created with LESS instead of SASS, which is our "go to" css preprocessor. We also try to go for a more minimal, clean and modern design.

### Documentation
As this template is still in very early stages of development a documentation is not yet available but the [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) may be a good first start for you to check out, as we try to use as many elements from it as possible.

### Contribute
It's probably to early to contribute yet, but if want to contribute you can fork this repo and create a pull request.

When you downloaded the code install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

We included a small locale development server. You can start it by running:
```bash
npm run serve
```

You can watch the assets and autocompile by running:
```bash
npm run watch
```

If you want to create a production build:
```bash
npm run production
```
